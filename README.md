# Revolutionizing-Agriculture-with-Computer-Vision
AI-powered crop monitoring system using Computer Vision and Machine Learning to detect plant diseases, pest infestations, and growth patterns. Provides real-time insights from crop images to support precision farming, improve decision-making, reduce losses, and increase agricultural productivity.
<p><strong>Crop Monitoring Using Computer Vision</strong></p>
<p>An AI-powered agriculture solution that uses computer vision and machine learning to monitor crop health, detect diseases, identify pests, and improve farming decisions in real time.</p>

**Overview**

Modern agriculture faces multiple challenges such as pest attacks, plant diseases, nutrient deficiencies, and unpredictable weather conditions. This project leverages Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to automate crop monitoring and provide timely insights to farmers.
The system analyzes plant images and aerial data to detect early signs of crop issues, helping farmers take preventive measures, reduce losses, and maximize yield.

**Objectives**

<p>Automate crop health monitoring</p>
<p>Detect plant diseases at an early stage</p>
<p>Identify pest infestations using image analysis</p>
<p>Track crop growth and development</p>
<p>Support precision farming with AI-driven insights</p>

**Features**

Early pest detection using computer vision
Plant disease identification using trained AI models
Crop growth monitoring and analysis
Aerial image analysis for large-scale farms
AI-driven insights for better agricultural decisions

**Technologies Used**

<p>
Python &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
OpenCV &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Machine Learning &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Computer Vision &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
